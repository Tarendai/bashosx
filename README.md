# Toms Bash Scripts

Primarily aimed at my OS X machine, this is a set of bash scripts I git clone into ~/bash_osx, including small pieces of automation, prompts and alias' etc

Update your .bash_profile to include this line to get started, then open a new tab:

```
source ${HOME}/bashosx/init.sh
```
